<!-- Propose a checklist of suggestions to implement: -->

- [ ] Need to xyz from abc...
- [ ] Then perhaps, apply 123 to 789 under...
- [ ] As well as, provide diagrams to demonstrate...

<!--
Include references and URLs etc. to whatever may help convey the point to resolve the issue.

Also note: "Summary Name" implies a short title that directs attention to the area needing focus.
Say you're working on 'Assignment X' with a group; Assignment X involves a document with many paragraphs and
headings to be implemented/filled-out then submitted.
When creating an issue for Assignment X, you would not put "Assignment X" in the title;
instead you'd place the name of the heading or
a summary name that represents an area inside the document for Assignment X.

Please delete all comments and example template data before submitting this issue or cancel this issue and
make a blank issue to fill-out for submission instead.
